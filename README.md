# Movie-Recommendation-model

This is a content based movie recommendation system.

Content based recommendation system suggest similar items based on a particular item.
This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.

This notebook is divided into two parts . In the first part i have built a model which recommends based on the plot of the movie.
In the second part i have built a model which recommends based on the genre , the director , the cast and other keywords.

The results of the two models-
1. Plot/overview based -
